WebGL Volume Rendering
====================

This repository is an adaptation of the code at 

https://github.com/lebarba/WebGLVolumeRendering

to display cornea images. Cornea images do not always have square dimensions which are powers of 2. So the code needs to be modified to work with arbitrary images.
